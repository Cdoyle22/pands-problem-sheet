#Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input 
# and outputs an approximation of its square root.
#Author: Ciara Doyle
#create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> 
# look at the newton method at estimating square roots
#"Please enter a positive number:"
#"The square root of" x "is approx. "



#Newtonâ€™s Method:

#Let N be any number then the square root of N can be given by the formula: 
#root = 0.5 * (X + (N / X)) where X is any guess 
# which can be assumed to be N or 1.

    #needed to call the function something different as it can only have letters and _ included

   while True:
        estimate = (estimate + N / estimate) / 2
        difference = abs(N - estimate ** 2)
        if difference <= tolerance:

   return estimate
